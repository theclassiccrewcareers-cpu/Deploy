# How the Application Detects Localhost vs Server

## Current Configuration ✅

The code is **already set up correctly** to automatically detect whether it's running on localhost or the production server.

### In `script.js` (line 2-7):

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = (window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1' || window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.protocol === 'file:')
    ? 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api'  // ← Used when on localhost
    : '/api';                       // ← Used when on server (relative path)
```

## How It Works:

### On Localhost (Development):
- URL: `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- API calls go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
- This works for local development

### On Production Server (Render):
- URL: `https://nexuxbackend.onrender.com`
- API calls go to: `/api` (relative path)
- This automatically becomes: `https://nexuxbackend.onrender.com/api`
- **No configuration needed - it just works!**

## Why This Works:

The code uses a **relative path** (`/api`) when not on localhost. This means:
- When accessed from `https://nexuxbackend.onrender.com`, `/api` becomes `https://nexuxbackend.onrender.com/api`
- When accessed from `https://yourdomain.com`, `/api` becomes `https://yourdomain.com/api`
- It automatically adapts to whatever domain the app is running on

## Current Status:

✅ **Already configured correctly!**
- Works on localhost automatically
- Works on server automatically
- No changes needed

## Verification:

To verify it's working on the server:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: `API_BASE_URL`
4. On server, it should show: `/api`
5. On localhost, it should show: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

## The Only Thing Needed:

The only thing that needs to be configured is **Google Cloud Console** to authorize your production domain. The code itself is already set up correctly!
